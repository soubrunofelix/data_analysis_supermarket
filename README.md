### Project Description
<br>

Have you ever wondered how the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has been affecting the supermarket business around the world? 
Well, I have, lately I can't stop thinking about it once I left my parent's home a few months ago and my trips to the supermarket increased. So, I decided to investigate this dark side of the force (if you know what I mean) combining my purchasing needs and this sector in Brazil which grapples with soaring food prices.
<br>
Let's dive into the project, the analysis was done using data from a supermarket based in SÃ£o Paulo/Brazil with a database containing information on 63 million sales record, I evaluated the amount of sales from 2019 to 2021 Looking at Food sales trend, Consumer and Prices behaviour over the following pandemic scenario: Before Covid-19; During Covid-19; After Vaccine period.
