## Project Description

Have you ever wondered how the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has been affecting the supermarket business around the world?
<br>
Well, I have, and lately I can't stop thinking about it once I left my parent's house a few months ago, hence my trips to the supermarket have increased.
<br>
That's why I decided to investigate this dark side of the force (*if you know what I mean*) combining my purchasing needs and this sector in Brazil which grapples with soaring food prices.
<br>
Let's dive into the project, the analysis was done using data from a supermarket based in SÃ£o Paulo/Brazil with a database containing information on 63 million sales record, I evaluated the amount of sales from 2019 to 2021 Looking at Food sales trend, Consumer and Prices behaviour over the following pandemic scenario: Before Covid-19; During Covid-19; After Vaccine period.
<br>
So, grab a trolley and come with me through the aisles of this supermarket.
