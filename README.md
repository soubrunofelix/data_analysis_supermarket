## Project Description

Have you ever wondered how the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has been affecting the supermarket business around the world?
<br>
Well, I have, and lately I can't stop thinking about it once I left my parent's house a few months ago, hence my trips to the supermarket have increased.
<br>
That's why I decided to investigate this dark side of the force (*if you know what I mean*) combining my purchasing needs and this sector in Brazil which grapples with soaring food prices.
<br>
Let's dive into the project, the analysis was done using data from a supermarket based in São Paulo/Brazil with a database containing information on 63 million sales record, I evaluated the amount of sales from 2019 to 2021 Looking at Food sales trend, Consumer and Prices behaviour over the following pandemic scenario: Before Covid-19; During Covid-19; After Vaccine period.
<br>
So, grab a trolley and come with me through the aisles of this supermarket.

<br>

## Project Main Objectives

- Gathering and Cleaning data in order to devolop a modern **Business Intelligence Strategy** for the supermarket:
- Discovering **consumers patterns** over the scenarios;
- Understanding **prices patterns** over the scenarios;
- Which changes in consumer behaviour can **create opportunities in 2022**?
- Having knowledge of **revenue status**;

<br>

## Diving into the Analysis

After the extraction from the dataset and data cleaning, it is possible to acknowledge the top selling products along the period observed. Following this stage, we began the process of analysis, comparison to the market and monitoring of the information obtained.
<br>
<br>
When the pandemic broke out in Brazil, in March 2020, there were dramatic changes in most of brazilians’ **shopping behaviour**.
<br>
You must have seen at least one piece of news about **out-of-stock** products on supermarket shelves around the world, and after the first round of analysis I realized that the local supermarket was no different, and based on it a **consumer pattern** was discovered, so-called by me, as **traditional brazilian family** behaviour.
<br>
And this data is telling us what kind of products the traditional brazilian Family considers to be **fundamental** for its survival in times of a global pandemic, so let’s take a deeper look into this list of foods that are musts at brazilians’ table:
<br>
	>>> Rice and beans, both keep similar sales behaviour over the years.
<br>
You might be asking yourself: why are these two considered essentials?
<br>
When we speak about our clients stocking food, we view the peak and record of sales of these foods at the beginning of the pandemic, as well as coffee, sugar, and also fruits.
<br>
Even though the prices of these foods are on the rise after the ‘post-vaccine’ period, the demand for them is still high. We can tell that these are products of need from the eyes of the consumers.
